## üö® Critical Issues (Immediate Attention Required)

These issues create accessibility barriers and should be fixed immediately:

### 1. Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order

**Impact:** Medium
**Description:** Properly ordered headings that do not skip levels convey the semantic structure of the page, making it easier to navigate and understand when using assistive technologies. [Learn more about heading order](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/heading-order).

**Affected Elements:**
- `<h3 data-lov-id="src/components/ReceiptCredentialIssuer.tsx:521:20" data-lov-name="h3" data-component-path="src/components/ReceiptCredentialIssuer.tsx" data-component-line="521" data-component-file="ReceiptCredentialIssuer.tsx" data-component-name="h3" data-component-content="%7B%22className%22%3A%22text-%5B20px%5D%20leading-%5B32px%5D%20sm%3Atext-%‚Ä¶" class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] sm:text-[22px] sm:leading-[33px] font-semibold ‚Ä¶">`
  - Fix any of the following:
  Heading order invalid

**Remediation:**
Use heading tags (h1-h6) in logical hierarchical order without skipping levels.

## üìã Manual Review Items

These items require human verification:

### 1. Interactive controls are keyboard focusable

Custom interactive controls are keyboard focusable and display a focus indicator. [Learn how to make custom controls focusable](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/focusable-controls/).

### 2. Interactive elements indicate their purpose and state

Interactive elements, such as links and buttons, should indicate their state and be distinguishable from non-interactive elements. [Learn how to decorate interactive elements with affordance hints](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/interactive-element-affordance/).

### 3. The page has a logical tab order

Tabbing through the page follows the visual layout. Users cannot focus elements that are offscreen. [Learn more about logical tab ordering](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/logical-tab-order/).

### 4. Visual order on the page follows DOM order

DOM order matches the visual order, improving navigation for assistive technology. [Learn more about DOM and visual ordering](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/visual-order-follows-dom/).

### 5. User focus is not accidentally trapped in a region

A user can tab into and out of any control or region without accidentally trapping their focus. [Learn how to avoid focus traps](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/focus-traps/).

### 6. The user's focus is directed to new content added to the page

If new content, such as a dialog, is added to the page, the user's focus is directed to it. [Learn how to direct focus to new content](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/managed-focus/).

### 7. HTML5 landmark elements are used to improve navigation

Landmark elements (`<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.) are used to improve the keyboard navigation of the page for assistive technology. [Learn more about landmark elements](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/use-landmarks/).

### 8. Offscreen content is hidden from assistive technology

Offscreen content is hidden with display: none or aria-hidden=true. [Learn how to properly hide offscreen content](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/offscreen-content-hidden/).

### 9. Custom controls have associated labels

Custom interactive controls have associated labels, provided by aria-label or aria-labelledby. [Learn more about custom controls and labels](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/custom-controls-labels/).

### 10. Custom controls have ARIA roles

Custom interactive controls have appropriate ARIA roles. [Learn how to add roles to custom controls](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/custom-control-roles/).

## ‚úÖ Passed Accessibility Checks

Congratulations! These accessibility requirements are being met:

1. **`[aria-*]` attributes match their roles** - Each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes. Mismatching these invalidates the `aria-*` attributes. [Learn how to match ARIA attributes to their roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-allowed-attr).
2. **Uses ARIA roles only on compatible elements** - Many HTML elements can only be assigned certain ARIA roles. Using ARIA roles where they are not allowed can interfere with the accessibility of the web page. [Learn more about ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-allowed-role).
3. **ARIA attributes are used as specified for the element's role** - Some ARIA attributes are only allowed on an element under certain conditions. [Learn more about conditional ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-conditional-attr).
4. **Deprecated ARIA roles were not used** - Deprecated ARIA roles may not be processed correctly by assistive technology. [Learn more about deprecated ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-deprecated-role).
5. **`[aria-hidden="true"]` is not present on the document `<body>`** - Assistive technologies, like screen readers, work inconsistently when `aria-hidden="true"` is set on the document `<body>`. [Learn how `aria-hidden` affects the document body](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-hidden-body).
6. **`[aria-hidden="true"]` elements do not contain focusable descendents** - Focusable descendents within an `[aria-hidden="true"]` element prevent those interactive elements from being available to users of assistive technologies like screen readers. [Learn how `aria-hidden` affects focusable elements](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-hidden-focus).
7. **Elements use only permitted ARIA attributes** - Using ARIA attributes in roles where they are prohibited can mean that important information is not communicated to users of assistive technologies. [Learn more about prohibited ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-prohibited-attr).
8. **`[role]`s have all required `[aria-*]` attributes** - Some ARIA roles have required attributes that describe the state of the element to screen readers. [Learn more about roles and required attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-required-attr).
9. **`[role]` values are valid** - ARIA roles must have valid values in order to perform their intended accessibility functions. [Learn more about valid ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-roles).
10. **`[aria-*]` attributes have valid values** - Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid values. [Learn more about valid values for ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-valid-attr-value).
11. **`[aria-*]` attributes are valid and not misspelled** - Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid names. [Learn more about valid ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/aria-valid-attr).
12. **Buttons have an accessible name** - When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. [Learn how to make buttons more accessible](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/button-name).
13. **Background and foreground colors have a sufficient contrast ratio** - Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. [Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/color-contrast).
14. **Document has a `<title>` element** - The title gives screen reader users an overview of the page, and search engine users rely on it heavily to determine if a page is relevant to their search. [Learn more about document titles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/document-title).
15. **`<html>` element has a `[lang]` attribute** - If a page doesn't specify a `lang` attribute, a screen reader assumes that the page is in the default language that the user chose when setting up the screen reader. If the page isn't actually in the default language, then the screen reader might not announce the page's text correctly. [Learn more about the `lang` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/html-has-lang).
16. **`<html>` element has a valid value for its `[lang]` attribute** - Specifying a valid [BCP 47 language](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags#question) helps screen readers announce text properly. [Learn how to use the `lang` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/html-lang-valid).
17. **Image elements have `[alt]` attributes** - Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternate text. Decorative elements can be ignored with an empty alt attribute. [Learn more about the `alt` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/image-alt).
18. **Image elements do not have `[alt]` attributes that are redundant text.** - Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternative text. Alternative text that is exactly the same as the text adjacent to the link or image is potentially confusing for screen reader users, because the text will be read twice. [Learn more about the `alt` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/image-redundant-alt).
19. **Links have a discernible name** - Link text (and alternate text for images, when used as links) that is discernible, unique, and focusable improves the navigation experience for screen reader users. [Learn how to make links accessible](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/link-name).
20. **Lists contain only `<li>` elements and script supporting elements (`<script>` and `<template>`).** - Screen readers have a specific way of announcing lists. Ensuring proper list structure aids screen reader output. [Learn more about proper list structure](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/list).
21. **`[user-scalable="no"]` is not used in the `<meta name="viewport">` element and the `[maximum-scale]` attribute is not less than 5.** - Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. [Learn more about the viewport meta tag](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/meta-viewport).
22. **Skip links are focusable.** - Including a skip link can help users skip to the main content to save time. [Learn more about skip links](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/skip-link).
23. **No element has a `[tabindex]` value greater than 0** - A value greater than 0 implies an explicit navigation ordering. Although technically valid, this often creates frustrating experiences for users who rely on assistive technologies. [Learn more about the `tabindex` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/tabindex).
24. **Touch targets have sufficient size and spacing.** - Touch targets with sufficient size and spacing help users who may have difficulty targeting small controls to activate the targets. [Learn more about touch targets](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/target-size).
25. **Elements with visible text labels have matching accessible names.** - Visible text labels that do not match the accessible name can result in a confusing experience for screen reader users. [Learn more about accessible names](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/label-content-name-mismatch).
