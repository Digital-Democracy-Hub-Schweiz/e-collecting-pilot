## Current Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Color Contrast Issues (High Priority)
**WCAG Reference:** 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)  
**Impact:** High - Affects users with visual impairments  
**Status:** Ongoing issue, may be reduced in scope from previous report

#### Current Problems:
- Multiple span elements with insufficient contrast ratios
- Located in service status or footer areas
- Elements using `font-medium` class showing contrast failures

#### Recommended Remediation:
```css
/* Ensure all text meets minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
.font-medium {
  /* Current color may need adjustment */
  color: #1f2937; /* Ensure sufficient contrast against background */
}

/* For colored text on dark backgrounds */
.text-status {
  color: #ffffff; /* White text for dark backgrounds */
}

/* For light backgrounds */
.text-on-light {
  color: #111827; /* Dark text for light backgrounds */
}
```

**Testing Required:**
- Use WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify all color combinations
- Test at minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- Test at minimum 3:1 ratio for large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)

### 2. Heading Hierarchy Issues (Medium Priority)
**WCAG Reference:** 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)  
**Impact:** Moderate - Affects content structure understanding  
**Status:** Evolved from H3 issue to H4 issue

#### Current Problems:
- H4 elements appearing without proper H1, H2, H3 hierarchy
- Multiple instances in grid layout sections

#### Recommended Remediation:
```tsx
// Option 1: Fix hierarchy by adding missing levels
<main>
  <h1>E-Collecting Pilot Project</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Main Section Title</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Subsection Title</h3>
      <h4>Current H4 Content</h4> {/* Now properly ordered */}
    </div>
  </section>
</main>

// Option 2: Convert to appropriate level
<h2 className="text-base font-semibold">
  {/* Previous H4 content */}
</h2>

// Option 3: Use non-semantic styling if not actually a heading
<div className="text-base font-semibold" role="presentation">
  {/* Previous H4 content */}
</div>
```
